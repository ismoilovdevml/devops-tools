# Stress Test Script Manual

This manual provides a guide on how to use a Bash script to perform a stress test on a given IP address. The script sends a specified number of HTTP requests, with a specified number of concurrent requests, to the target IP address and measures the time taken to complete the test.

>Remember to use this script responsibly and only target servers you have permission to test.
